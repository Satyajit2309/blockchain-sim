# üöó Blockchain Simulation ‚Äì Vehicle History Tracker

This project is a **Flask-based simulation** of a **Blockchain network** built for a *Vehicle History Tracker* application.  
It visually demonstrates how blockchain concepts like **consensus, immutability, decentralization, and transparency** work ‚Äî without using a real blockchain.

---

## üîç Overview

- Users can **register vehicles** (simulated transactions).  
- Multiple **admins** act as validators and can **approve or reject** each transaction.  
- Once the **majority approves**, the transaction is added as a **block** to the simulated blockchain.  
- The **Blockchain Explorer** lets you view blocks, hashes, and full vehicle history.  
- The simulation mimics real blockchain behavior ‚Äî but runs entirely locally using Flask and JSON storage.
